# Update-VDIPool
A script to 'recompose' a manual VDI desktop pool

-------------------------------------------------
This script was created for a customer who needed to automate the rebuilding or 'recompose' action on a
manual desktop pool.  The desktop pool had to be a manual pool because the virtual desktops it contained
were not able to be domain joined.  Automated pools are only possible if the desktops are successfully
joined to an Active Directory domain.
